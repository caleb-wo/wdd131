        description: "I primarily worked here during summers. I was placed on the graveyard shift (10pm - 6am). My responsiblities consisted of cleaning, property up-keep, running orders to customers, preparing rooms, and essentially anything else needed. I was trusted to get my work done and help the front desk without any supervision. Oftentimes, it was called upon me to act as security in moments of necessity. These opportunities helped me to learn how to remain calm underpressure and tell others 'no' when it's necessary. I also learned how to leverage my time. Even on graveyard shift, I found time in my life to diet, workout, and even do a half a semester of school online."

        description: "I worked here while at school in Rexburg. I was a survey interviewer. Here we would cold call numbers from a databank with the goal having the individual take a survey. I was a high performer and almost never fell below our shift quotas——even when a survey would take 30+ minutes. While working here I learned how to simplify complex questions for the various indivisuals I'd interact with. I learned how to communicate clearly and respectably; I was always aware that I was representing my boss and organization."

I work in a division of the BYU-I Support Center, more specifically I work in the Digital Communications department. Here we answer questions and concerns through live chat and email. As a support center agent, I am responsible for answering diverse questions by referencing data in our knowledge base and other public resources. I document each interaction and also make the decision when a situation should be escalated to a higher office. I often work and interact with other offices and seek to harmonize our work flows. Recently, I was promoted to be a Team Lead Assistant. I assist the Team-lead in guiding and supporting the agents on our team. I have lead team huddles before the working portion of our shift. I also answer the questions of our agents when they need help or input from a more experienced individual."
